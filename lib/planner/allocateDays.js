/**
 * Step 1 — give each chapter a whole number of days, in proportion to its
 * TOPIC COUNT.
 *
 * The commerce workbook carries no page counts, so topics are the unit of
 * work: a chapter with twice the topics gets twice the days, and every day
 * therefore holds roughly the same number of topics. With A=6 topics and
 * B=9 topics over 10 days: A takes 6/15 = 40% → 4 days, B takes 60% → 6 days.
 * Both then run at 1.5 topics/day.
 *
 * Two constraints bend the pure proportion:
 *   - min 1 day: a selected chapter always gets studied.
 *   - max `topicCount` days: you can't spread 2 topics over 4 days without
 *     leaving 2 of them empty, so it's capped and the spare days go to
 *     chapters that can use them.
 *
 * Because the weight and the cap are now the same quantity, the proportional
 * share never exceeds the cap on its own — the cap only ever bites after the
 * min-1 floor has been applied.
 *
 * @param {{topicCount:number}[]} chapters
 * @param {number} days  total study days to divide up
 * @returns {number[]} days per chapter, summing to `days` (or to the total
 *                     topic count if there simply aren't enough topics to fill).
